# Bitloops

Bitloops is a comprehensive backend development platform, offering end-to-end backend services for Web, Mobile, Native, or server apps. 
Bitloops allows developers to manage their entire backend on a single intuitive platform, which is built for scalability, flexibility and creativity. In essence, Bitloops consists of the following:

- Backend-as-a-Service: authentication, realtime database, storage, hosting, subscriptions and notifications, cloud infrastructure
- Low-code (drag & drop) IDE that allows developers to build actual backend services through picoservices and business logic abstraction into workflows
- Instant code deployment into development, testing or production environments
- Integration platform-as-a-service that allows integration of any application, microservice or 3rd party service

Bitloops removes the complexity and repetitiveness required to build and deploy a modern backend application, API or database from scratch and allows you to continue scaling and extending your applications faster than any other tool. 

Using Bitloops, you can easily integrate your application with user authentication & multiple sign-in methods, any database for storing and querying users and data, storage and file management, image & video manipulation as well as hosting for your website. In addition, you can continue building new products and features, or iterate existing features / business logic 10x faster than with traditional tools. 

Bitloops is the only platform you need for all your backend needs.
